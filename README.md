## 📝 Description

**Pi-Pokemon** is an experimental project that fuses math and retro gaming. Using pi’s decimal expansion, the project determines actions, moves, and other aspects of the gameplay, making every session as unpredictable as the digits of pi itself! With Python, PyBoy, and a sprinkle of creativity, **Pi-Pokemon** offers a truly unique Pokémon experience where numbers shape your adventure.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Actions**: Uses pi's decimals to determine actions and moves in the game.
- **Unique Gameplay**: Every action is guided by the infinite sequence of pi, offering endless variations.
- **Pokémon Compatibility**: Compatible with Game Boy versions of Pokémon games (tested with Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow).

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pi-pokemon.git

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a legally dumped ROM of Pokémon Gold (or another Game Boy Pokémon title) and place it in the project directory. Note: This project does not condone or support the use of ROMs obtained illegally. Please dump your own copy from a legally owned cartridge.

## ▶️ Usage
Run the main script, specifying the path to your Pokémon ROM. For example:
   ```bash
      python pi_pokemon.py
```
The script will begin using pi’s digits to control the character and interact with the Pokémon world in unpredictable ways.

## 📖 Examples of Use
Here’s how Pi-Pokemon leverages pi’s digits to influence gameplay:

**Character Movement**: Pi’s digits are used to determine movement directions (e.g., 1 = b, 4 = right).
